## Protocols
### TCP/IP
Transfer Control Protocol is a connection-oriented protocol, meaning TCP is slow but guarantees the delivery of the data, in order they were sent and provides errors.
The max TCP port range is 65535.

#### Scanning
NMAP can be used to scan the target TCP ports.

Tip: You can also put -p- instead to scan the entire range.
```
root@linux: nmap -p0-65535 <ip>
```

### UDP


## Protocols & Services
### FTP
File Transfer Protocol runs on port 21 is used to upload, download and view files. Its often alos known as SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol).

#### Anonymous Login
AL is a login mechanism that allows any user to login without a user or password. Normally this does not allow to upload files but you can still download and view files.
