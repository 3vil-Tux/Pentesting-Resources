## Protocols
### TCP
Transfer Control Protocol (aka TCP/IP) is a connection-oriented protocol, meaning TCP is sloer than UDP cause it creates a connection between the sender and receiver but guarantees the delivery of the data, in order they were sent and provides errors.
The max TCP port range is 65535.

#### Scanning
NMAP can be used to scan the target TCP ports.
Tip: You can also put -p- instead to scan the entire range.
```
root@linux: nmap -p0-65535 <ip>
```

### UDP
User Datagram Protocol is a connectionless protocol, meaning UDP is a lot faster than TCP cause it does not create a connection between the sender and receiver but does not guarrantees the delivery of the data, not in order they were sent and does not provide errors.
The max UDP port range is 65535.

#### Scanning
NMAP can be used to scan UDP ports.
```
root@linux: nmap -sU -p0-65535 <ip>
```


## Protocols & Services
### FTP
File Transfer Protocol runs on port 21 is used to upload, download and view files. Its often alos known as SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol).

#### Anonymous Login
AL is a login mechanism that allows any user to login without a user or password. Normally this does not allow to upload files but you can still download and view files.

Username: anonymous  
Password: anonymous@domain.com OR anonymous OR nothing
```
